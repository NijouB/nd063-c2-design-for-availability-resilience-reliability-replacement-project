Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage: In a Multi-AZ deployment, the primary database instance is synchronously replicated to a standby instance in a different availability zone (AZ). Therefore, if a single AZ outage occurs, AWS's failover mechanism is activated, and the standby instance in another AZ takes over as the primary. This failover process is typically automatic and can be completed within a few minutes, often in the range of 1 to 2 minutes. Consequently, the minimum RTO for a single AZ outage is approximately 1 to 2 minutes.

Minimum RTO for a single region outage: In the case of a single region outage, failover to another region requires more than just a switch to a standby instance due to the added complexity of cross-region replication and potential data synchronization. Generally, with continuous asynchronous replication and automated backups, the process could take from a few minutes to a couple of hours based on the volume of data and the readiness of the failover site. Therefore, the minimum RTO for a single region outage could be expected to range from 30 minutes to a few hours.

Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage: In a Multi-AZ setup, since data is synchronously replicated across AZs, there is little to no data loss in the event of a single AZ outage. This means that the minimum achievable RPO is effectively zero, as the data on the standby instance is continuously updated in real-time.

Minimum RPO for a single region outage: For multi-region databases, the replication mechanism is typically asynchronous to balance performance and latency. This introduces a slight lag between the primary and the replicated data in the secondary region. The RPO for a region-level failure is determined by the frequency of replication, which in many solutions is near real-time but can vary depending on the specific setup. In practice, this means the minimum achievable RPO could be a matter of seconds to a few minutes, as recent updates not yet replicated might be lost during the failover.
